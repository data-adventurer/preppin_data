--- Challenge by Carl Allchin

--- This week we are going to be focusing on cleaning data ready to answer some questions from our stakeholders. In the requirements I will be adding some links to some useful resources if you get stuck on a particular requirement. 

--- Requirements
--- Here's what we need you to do:
--- Connect and load the csv file (help)
--- Split the 'Store-Bike' field into 'Store' and 'Bike' (help)
--- Clean up the 'Bike' field to leave just three values in the 'Bike' field (Mountain, Gravel, Road) (help)
--- Create two different cuts of the date field: 'quarter' and 'day of month' (help)
--- Remove the first 10 orders as they are test values (help)
--- Output the data as a csv (help)

--- My solution
SELECT  QUARTER(date) AS quarter,
        TRIM(SPLIT_PART(store_bike,'-',1)) AS store,
        CASE
            WHEN SPLIT_PART(store_bike,'-',2) LIKE 'M%' THEN 'Mountain'
            WHEN SPLIT_PART(store_bike,'-',2) LIKE 'G%' THEN 'Gravel'
            WHEN SPLIT_PART(store_bike,'-',2) LIKE 'R%' THEN 'Road'
            ELSE 'Blank'
        END AS bike,
        order_id,
        customer_age,
        bike_value,
        existing_customer,
        DAY(date) AS day_of_month
FROM PD2021_WK01
ORDER BY date
LIMIT NULL OFFSET 10;

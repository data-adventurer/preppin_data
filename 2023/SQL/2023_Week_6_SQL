--- Challenge by Jenny Martin

--- Reshape the data so we have 5 rows for each customer, with responses for the Mobile App and Online Interface being in separate fields on the same row
--- Clean the question categories so they don't have the platform in from of them
---     - e.g. Mobile App - Ease of Use should be simply Ease of Use
--- Exclude the Overall Ratings, these were incorrectly calculated by the system
--- Calculate the Average Ratings for each platform for each customer 
--- Calculate the difference in Average Rating between Mobile App and Online Interface for each customer
--- Catergorise customers as being:
---     - Mobile App Superfans if the difference is greater than or equal to 2 in the Mobile App's favour
---    - Mobile App Fans if difference >= 1
---     - Online Interface Fan
---     - Online Interface Superfan
---     - Neutral if difference is between 0 and 1
--- Calculate the Percent of Total customers in each category, rounded to 1 decimal place

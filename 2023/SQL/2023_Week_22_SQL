--- Challenge by Tanbir Jalil

--- First we must join the test score data set and the additional class attendance data set 
--- Clean Data: there’s a few spelling mistakes in the data set, use the data tool of your choice to correct these mistakes before we proceed. These mistakes are in the “Subject”  Column
--- Clean up the test score column, so each number is a rounded to the nearest whole number
--- Split the student name column so we can see the first name and surname in two separate columns, named appropriately
--- If any student has an attendance percentage less than 70%, flag it as "Low Attendance" in a new column "attendance flag". Conversely, if above 90%, flag as “high attendance”. And anything else as “Medium”.

--- My solution
SELECT  CASE 
            WHEN attendance_percentage < 70 THEN 'Low Attendance'
            WHEN attendance_percentage > 90 THEN 'High Attendance'
            ELSE 'Medium'
        END AS attendance_flag,
        SPLIT_PART(ts.student_name,'_',1) AS first_name,
        SPLIT_PART(ts.student_name,'_',2) AS surname,
        attendance_percentage,
        student_id,
        CASE subject
            WHEN 'Engish' THEN 'English'
            WHEN 'Sciece' THEN 'Science'
            WHEN 'Math' THEN 'Math'
        END AS subject,
        test_score,
        ROUND(test_score,0) AS test_score_integer
FROM PD2023_WK22_STUDENT_TEST_SCORES AS ts
LEFT JOIN PD2023_WK22_ATTENDANCE_FIGURES AS af
ON ts.student_name = af.student_name;

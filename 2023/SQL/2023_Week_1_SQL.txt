--- Created by Carl Allchin

--- Split the Transaction Code to extract the letters at the start of the transaction code. These identify the bank who processes the transaction 
    --- Rename the new field with the Bank code 'Bank'. 
--- Rename the values in the Online or In-person field, Online of the 1 values and In-Person for the 2 values. 
--- Change the date to be the day of the week
--- Different levels of detail are required in the outputs. You will need to sum up the values of the transactions in three ways:
    --- 1. Total Values of Transactions by each bank
    -- 2. Total Values by Bank, Day of the Week and Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person)
    --- 3. Total Values by Bank and Customer Code

--- Total Values of Transactions by Bank
-- SELECT  bank,
--         SUM(value) AS value
-- FROM prepared_data
-- GROUP BY bank;

--- Total Values by Bank, Day of the Week and Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person)
-- SELECT  bank,
--         online_or_in_person,
--         transaction_date,
--         SUM(value) AS value
-- FROM prepared_data
-- GROUP BY 1,2,3;

--- Total Values by Bank and Customer Code
---SELECT  bank,
--         customer_code,
--         SUM(value) AS value
-- FROM prepared_data
-- GROUP BY 1,2;

--- Challenge by Jenny Martin

--- In the Transactions table, there is a Sort Code field which contains dashes. We need to remove these so just have a 6 digit string
--- Use the SWIFT Bank Code lookup table to bring in additional information about the SWIFT code and Check Digits of the receiving bank account
--- Add a field for the Country Code
      -- Hint: all these transactions take place in the UK so the Country Code should be GB
--- Create the IBAN as above
      -- Hint: watch out for trying to combine string fields with numeric fields - check data types
--- Remove unnecessary fields

--- My solution
WITH transactions_and_sc AS
    (SELECT  transaction_id,
            account_number,
            REPLACE(sort_code, '-', '') AS sort_code,
            ts.bank,
            swift_code,
            check_digits,
            'GB' AS country_code
    FROM PD2023_WK02_TRANSACTIONS AS ts
    LEFT JOIN PD2023_WK02_SWIFT_CODES AS sc
    ON ts.BANK = sc.BANK)
    
SELECT  transaction_id,
        CONCAT(country_code,check_digits,swift_code,sort_code,account_number) AS IBAN
FROM transactions_and_sc;
